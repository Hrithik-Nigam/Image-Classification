# Image-Classification
This is a image classification based on machine learning techniques of Python 3. The whole code is written uses two models, one identifies brain tumor in a given MRI scan and other identifies presence of Pneumonia in the given CT scan of the chest.
Steps involved are as follows:
1.   Data gathering- done through Kaggle.
2.   Splitting data into training and testing sets.
3.   Importing models along with respective libraries.
4.   Selecting best model through hyperperameter tuning using GridSearchCV().
5.   Fitting data sets into models selected in step 4.
6.   Checking the accuracy score and precision score.
7.   Checking the output of arbitary data.
